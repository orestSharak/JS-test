Contents of the task:

01. list all objects from 'machines' array as html elements.
02. each html element must have 'Machine name', 'Product', 'OS' & 'Status' values displayed on the page.
03. Instead of displaying 'Product' abbreviations, display full product names.
04. ‘double-clicking’ the html element must update the list and only show the child machines of the selected element.(if machine 'ID' matches with another machine's 'Parent-ID', it means that they are related)
05. the machines with 'unreachable' status must be disabled(grayed out & not clickable).

TIP: The code/solutions must be universal, so do not focus on these specific objects & values, imagine you have many objects like these.
